## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development Approach
```typescript
// Example: Write test first
describe('engineToWorld transformation', () => {
  it('should transform FCC coordinates correctly', () => {
    const engine: EngineFCC = { x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 };
    const world = engineToWorld(engine);
    expect(world.x).toBeCloseTo(0.5);
    expect(world.y).toBeCloseTo(0.866);
    expect(world.z).toBeCloseTo(0);
  });
});

// Then implement the function
export function engineToWorld(coord: EngineFCC): WorldFCC {
  // Implementation follows test requirements
}
```

### Testing Pyramid
```
E2E Tests (10%)
├── Complete user workflows
├── Cross-browser compatibility
└── Performance benchmarks

Integration Tests (30%)
├── Component interactions
