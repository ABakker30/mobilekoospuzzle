# Koos Puzzle Vision Roadmap
*"The Minecraft of 3D Puzzles"*

## üåü Executive Summary

Koos Puzzle is evolving from a 3D puzzle visualization tool into a comprehensive platform that combines creative freedom, intelligent solving, community collaboration, and physical manufacturing. This document captures the complete vision and implementation strategy.

## üéØ Ultimate Vision

### The Platform
A unified 3D workspace where users can:
- **Create** puzzle shapes using FCC sphere arrangements
- **Solve** puzzles with AI assistance or manual interaction
- **Share** creations with a global community
- **Learn** crystallography, geometry, and problem-solving
- **Manufacture** physical versions of digital puzzles
- **Compete** in solving challenges and creative contests

### The Tagline
*"Where creativity meets mathematics, and digital imagination becomes physical reality."*

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Foundation

### Core Principles
1. **FCC Sphere-Based System**: All puzzles use Face-Centered Cubic coordinate arrangements
2. **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled components with clear interfaces
3. **Scalable Design**: Built to grow from personal tool to global platform
4. **Mathematical Rigor**: Proper geometric foundations for educational value

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Dual Coordinate Systems**: Engine (rhombohedral) vs World (visualization)
- **CID-Based Contracts**: Content-addressable storage for shapes and solutions
- **Unified Workspace**: Single 3D environment with multiple modes
- **Metadata Separation**: Pure geometric data separate from social/temporal data

## üéÆ Unified Workspace Architecture

### Four Primary Modes
1. **Puzzle Shape Mode**: Create and edit container shapes
2. **Auto Solve Mode**: Configure and run automated solving algorithms
3. **Manual Solve Mode**: Interactive piece placement and building
4. **View Solution Mode**: Browse and analyze existing solutions
5. **Piece Editor Mode**: Design custom pieces (future)

  // CID calculated from this pure data only
}

interface ShapeMetadata {
  cid: string;              // References ShapeContract
  creator: string;          // User ID
  createdAt: timestamp;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  tags: string[];
  difficulty?: number;
  popularity: number;
  symmetry: SymmetryQuality; // Crystallographic analysis
}
```

#### Solution Contract
```typescript
interface SolutionContract {
  version: string;
  shapeCID: string;         // References ShapeContract
  pieces: PiecePlacement[]; // Piece positions in engine coords
  // CID calculated from this pure data only
}

interface SolutionMetadata {
  cid: string;              // References SolutionContract
  solver: string;           // User ID
  solvedAt: timestamp;
  algorithm?: string;       // Solving method
  duration?: number;        // Time to solve
  rating?: number;          // Community rating
}
```

#### Status Contract (Ephemeral)
```typescript
interface StatusContract {
  sessionId: string;
  shapeCID: string;
  engine: string;
  state: 'idle' | 'solving' | 'complete' | 'error';
  progress?: number;        // 0-100%
  currentSolution?: Partial<SolutionContract>;
  metrics: EngineMetrics;
  // No CID - transient data
}
```

### Symmetry Analysis
```typescript
interface SymmetryQuality {
  rotationalSymmetry: {
    axes: SymmetryAxis[];
    order: number;          // Highest rotational symmetry order
  };
  reflectionalSymmetry: {
    planes: SymmetryPlane[];
    count: number;          // Number of mirror planes
  };
  pointGroup: string;       // Crystallographic point group
  symmetryScore: number;    // 0-1 overall symmetry measure
  isChiral: boolean;        // Has handedness
}
```
